  description: 'In the field of data privacy, a lack of rights or protections for
    individuals can lead to severe consequences, such as privacy violations and identity
    theft. To prevent these abuses, it is important to establish and enforce robust
    data privacy laws and regulations that provide individuals with clear rights
    and avenues for redress, as well as enforceable penalties for violations.
