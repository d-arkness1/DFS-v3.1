  description: a symmetric-key block cipher that was designed by Bruce Schneier in
    1993. It uses a variable-length key, ranging from 32 bits to 448 bits, and operates
    on 64-bit blocks of data. Blowfish is known for its fast encryption and decryption
    speed and has been used in many different applications, including e-commerce
    and virtual private networks (VPNs).
