  description: There is no comprehensive federal data protection law in the US. Instead,
    there are various sector-specific laws, such as the Health Insurance Portability
    and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act
    (COPPA), that regulate the handling of personal information in certain contexts.
